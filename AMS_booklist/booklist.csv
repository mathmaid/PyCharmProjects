The first part deals with fractional Sobolev spaces of one variable. It covers the definition, standard properties, extensions, embeddings, Hardy inequalities, and interpolation inequalities. The second part deals with fractional Sobolev spaces of several variables. The author studies completeness, density, homogeneous fractional Sobolev spaces, embeddings, necessary and sufficient conditions for extensions, Gagliardo-Nirenberg type interpolation inequalities, and trace theory. The third part explores some applications: interior regularity for the Poisson problem with the right-hand side in a fractional Sobolev space and some basic properties of the fractional Laplacian. <br /><br /> The first part of the book is accessible to advanced undergraduates with a strong background in integration theory; the second part, to graduate students having familiarity with measure and integration and some functional analysis. Basic knowledge of Sobolev spaces would help, but is not necessary. The book can also serve as a reference for mathematicians working in the calculus of variations and partial differential equations as well as for researchers in other disciplines with a solid mathematics background. It contains several exercises and is self-contained.</p> "

The author presents recent developments such as spacing shifts, square-free shifts, density shifts, \(\mathcal{B}\)-free shifts, Bratteli-Vershik systems, enumeration scales, amorphic complexity, and a modern and complete treatment of kneading theory. Later, he provides an overview of automata and linguistic complexity (Chomsky's hierarchy). <br /><br /> The necessary background for the book varies, but for most of it a solid knowledge of real analysis and linear algebra and first courses in probability and measure theory, metric spaces, number theory, topology, and set theory suffice.

After introducing the necessary prerequisites in measure theory and functional analysis, the exposition focuses on operator theory and especially the structure of self-adjoint operators. These can be viewed as infinite-dimensional analogues of Hermitian matrices; the infinite-dimensional setting leads to a richer theory which goes beyond eigenvalues and eigenvectors and studies self-adjoint operators in the language of spectral measures and the Borel functional calculus. The main approach to spectral theory adopted in the book is to present it as the interplay between three main classes of objects: self-adjoint operators, their spectral measures, and Herglotz functions, which are complex analytic functions mapping the upper half-plane to itself. Self-adjoint operators include many important classes of recurrence and differential operators; the later part of this book is dedicated to two of the most studied classes, Jacobi operators and one-dimensional Schr&ouml;dinger operators. <br /><br /> This text is intended as a course textbook or for independent reading for graduate students and advanced undergraduates. Prerequisites are linear algebra, a first course in analysis including metric spaces, and for parts of the book, basic complex analysis. Necessary results from measure theory and from the theory of Banach and Hilbert spaces are presented in the first three chapters of the book. Each chapter concludes with a number of helpful exercises.</p> "

Such locally homogeneous geometric structures are special cases of Cartan connections where the associated curvature vanishes. This theory received a big boost in the 1970s when W. Thurston put his geometrization program for 3-manifolds in this context. The subject of this book is more ambitious in scope. Unlike Thurston's eight 3-dimensional geometries, it covers structures which are not metric structures, such as affine and projective structures. <br /><br /> This book describes the known examples in dimensions one, two and three. Each geometry has its own special features, which provide special tools in its study. Emphasis is given to the interrelationships between different geometries and how one kind of geometric structure induces structures modeled on a different geometry. Up to now, much of the literature has been somewhat inaccessible and the book collects many of the pieces into one unified work. This book focuses on several successful classification problems. Namely, fix a geometry in the sense of Klein and a topological manifold.  Then the different ways of locally putting the geometry on the manifold lead to a &ldquo;moduli space&rdquo;. Often the moduli space carries a rich geometry of its own reflecting the model geometry. <br /><br /> The book is self-contained and accessible to students who have taken first-year graduate courses in topology, smooth manifolds, differential geometry and Lie groups.</p> "

One of the main applications of this approach to group theory is the study of asymptotic properties of groups such as growth and amenability. The book presents recently developed techniques of studying groups of dynamical origin using the structure of their orbits and associated groupoids of germs, applications of the iterated monodromy groups to hyperbolic dynamical systems, topological full groups and their properties, amenable groups, groups of intermediate growth, and other topics. The book is suitable for graduate students and researchers interested in group theory, transformations defined by automata, topological and holomorphic dynamics, and theory of topological groupoids.

Chapters 3, 4, and 5 cover the fundamentals of the Navier-Stokes theory: derivation, special solutions, existence theory for strong solutions, Leray theory of weak solutions, weak-strong uniqueness, existence theory of mild solutions, and Prodi-Serrin regularity criteria. Chapter 6 provides a short guide to the must-read topics, including active research directions, for an advanced graduate student working in incompressible fluids.

The first part of the book deals solely with ultrafilters and presents applications to voting theory, combinatorics, and topology, while also dealing also with foundational issues.  The second part presents the classical ultraproduct construction and provides applications to algebra, number theory, and nonstandard analysis.  The third part discusses a metric generalization of the ultraproduct construction and gives example applications to geometric group theory and functional analysis.

The poles of these meromorphic continuations capture physical information by identifying the rate of oscillation with the real part of a pole and the rate of decay with its imaginary part. An example from mathematics is given by the zeros of the Riemann zeta function: they are, essentially, the resonances of the Laplacian on the modular surface.

Three important dualities are presented in the book, with the unifying theme of determining irreducible characters of Lie superalgebras.  In order of increasing sophistication, they are Schur duality, Howe duality, and super duality. The combinatorics of symmetric functions is developed as needed in connections to Harish-Chandra homomorphism as well as irreducible characters for Lie superalgebras. Schur-Sergeev duality for the queer Lie superalgebra is presented from scratch with complete detail.  Howe duality for Lie superalgebras is presented in book form for the first time. Super duality is a new approach developed in the past few years toward understanding the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category of modules for classical Lie superalgebras. Super duality relates the representation theory of classical Lie superalgebras directly to the representation theory of classical Lie algebras and thus gives a solution to the irreducible character problem of Lie superalgebras via the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of classical Lie algebras.</p> "

Gowers, in groundbreaking work, developed many of the basic concepts of this theory in order to give a new, quantitative proof of Szemer&eacute;di's theorem on arithmetic progressions.

The author introduces a new class of stratified spaces, so-called stratifolds. He derives basic concepts from differential topology such as Sard's theorem, partitions of unity and transversality. Based on this, homology groups are constructed in the framework of stratifolds and the homology axioms are proved. This implies that for nice spaces these homology groups agree with ordinary singular homology. Besides the standard computations of homology groups using the axioms, straightforward constructions of important homology classes are given. The author also defines stratifold cohomology groups following an idea of Quillen. Again, certain important cohomology classes occur very naturally in this description, for example, the characteristic classes which are constructed in the book and applied later on. One of the most fundamental results, Poincar&eacute; duality, is almost a triviality in this approach. <br /><br /> Some fundamental invariants, such as the Euler characteristic and the signature, are derived from (co)homology groups.

Knot theory is the special case of spheres smoothly embedded in spheres; in this book, much more general spaces and much more general embeddings are considered.

Here, the perspective emphasizes their applications to Sobolev functions, giving a very different flavor to the treatment.  This elementary start to the book makes it suitable for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students.  Moreover, the one-variable part of the book helps to develop a solid background that facilitates the reading and understanding of Sobolev functions of several variables.   <br /><br /> The second part of the book is more classical, although it also contains some recent results. Besides the standard results on Sobolev functions, this part of the book includes chapters on BV functions, symmetric rearrangement, and Besov spaces.   <br /><br /> The book contains over 200 exercises.</p> "

In particular, he initiated the study of 4-configurations (that is, those that contain four points on each line, and four lines through each point); the results are fully described in the text. The main novelty in the approach to all geometric configurations is the concentration on their symmetries, which make it possible to deal with configurations of rather large sizes.

The Poisson summation formula treated in Chapter 3 provides an elegant connection between Fourier series on the circle and Fourier transforms on the real line, culminating in Landau's asymptotic formulas for lattice points on a large sphere. <br /><br /> Much of modern harmonic analysis is concerned with the behavior of various linear operators on the Lebesgue spaces \(L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)\).

The latter appears as a limit of a refinement of the discretization.  Current interest in discrete differential geometry derives not only from its importance in pure mathematics but also from its applications in computer graphics, theoretical physics, architecture, and numerics. Rather unexpectedly, the very basic structures of discrete differential geometry turn out to be related to the theory of integrable systems. One of the main goals of this book is to reveal this integrable structure of discrete differential geometry. <br /><br /> For a given smooth geometry one can suggest many different discretizations. Which one is the best?  This book answers this question by providing fundamental discretization principles and applying them to numerous concrete problems. It turns out that intelligent theoretical discretizations are distinguished also by their good performance in applications. <br /><br /> The intended audience of this book is threefold. It is a textbook on discrete differential geometry and integrable systems suitable for a one semester graduate course. On the other hand, it is addressed to specialists in geometry and mathematical physics. It reflects the recent progress in discrete differential geometry and contains many original results. The third group of readers at which this book is targeted is formed by specialists in geometry processing, computer graphics, architectural design, numerical simulations, and animation. They may find here answers to the question &ldquo;How do we discretize differential geometry?&rdquo; arising in their specific field. <br /><br /> Prerequisites for reading this book include standard undergraduate background (calculus and linear algebra). No knowledge of differential geometry is expected, although some familiarity with curves and surfaces can be helpful.</p> "

Their systematic study began around the world after 1950 mainly through the efforts of the Russian, Japanese, German, and Dutch schools. <br /><br /> Since cones are being employed to solve optimization problems, the theory of ordered vector spaces is an indispensable tool for solving a variety of applied problems appearing in several diverse areas, such as engineering, econometrics, and the social sciences. For this reason this theory plays a prominent role not only in functional analysis but also in a wide range of applications. <br /><br /> This is a book about a modern perspective on cones and ordered vector spaces. It includes material that has not been presented earlier in a monograph or a textbook. With many exercises of varying degrees of difficulty, the book is suitable for graduate courses. <br /><br /> Most of the new topics currently discussed in the book have their origins in problems from economics and finance. Therefore, the book will be valuable to any researcher and graduate student who works in mathematics, engineering, economics, finance, and any other field that uses optimization techniques.</p> "

It was discovered in the fifties that the solvability of differential relations (i.e. equations and inequalities) of this kind can often be reduced to a problem of a purely homotopy-theoretic nature.  One says in this case that the corresponding differential relation satisfies the \(h\)-principle. Two famous examples of the \(h\)-principle, the Nash-Kuiper \(C^1\)-isometric embedding theory in Riemannian geometry and the Smale-Hirsch immersion theory in differential topology, were later transformed by Gromov into powerful general methods for establishing the \(h\)-principle. <br /><br /> The authors cover two main methods for proving the \(h\)-principle: holonomic approximation and convex integration.

For instance, analytic number theory contains many examples of asymptotic expressions derived from estimates for analytic functions, such as in the proof of the Prime Number Theorem. In combinatorial number theory, exact formulas for number-theoretic quantities are derived from relations between analytic functions. Elliptic functions, especially theta functions, are an important class of such functions in this context, which had been made clear already in Jacobi's <span style=""font-style:italic"">Fundamenta nova</span>. Theta functions are also classically connected with Riemann surfaces and with the modular group \(\Gamma = \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\), which provide another path for insights into number theory. <br /><br /> Farkas and Kra, well-known masters of the theory of Riemann surfaces and the analysis of theta functions, uncover here interesting combinatorial identities by means of the function theory on Riemann surfaces related to the principal congruence subgroups \(\Gamma(k)\). For instance, the authors use this approach to derive congruences discovered by Ramanujan for the partition function, with the main ingredient being the construction of the same function in more than one way. The authors also obtain a variant on Jacobi's famous result on the number of ways that an integer can be represented as a sum of four squares, replacing the squares by triangular numbers and, in the process, obtaining a cleaner result. <br /><br /> The recent trend of applying the ideas and methods of algebraic geometry to the study of theta functions and number theory has resulted in great advances in the area. However, the authors choose to stay with the classical point of view. As a result, their statements and proofs are very concrete.  In this book the mathematician familiar with the algebraic geometry approach to theta functions and number theory will find many interesting ideas as well as detailed explanations and derivations of new and old results. <br /><br /> Highlights of the book include systematic studies of theta constant identities, uniformizations of surfaces represented by subgroups of the modular group, partition identities, and Fourier coefficients of automorphic functions. <br /><br /> Prerequisites are a solid understanding of complex analysis, some familiarity with Riemann surfaces, Fuchsian groups, and elliptic functions, and an interest in number theory. The book contains summaries of some of the required material, particularly for theta functions and theta constants. <br /><br /> Readers will find here a careful exposition of a classical point of view of analysis and number theory.

The first version of integration that students see is the Riemann integral.  Later, graduate students learn that the Lebesgue integral is &ldquo;better&rdquo; because it removes some restrictions on the integrands and the domains over which we integrate. However, there are still drawbacks to Lebesgue integration, for instance, dealing with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, or with &ldquo;improper&rdquo; integrals. <br /><br /> This book is an introduction to a relatively new theory of the integral (called the &ldquo;generalized Riemann integral&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Henstock-Kurzweil integral&rdquo;) that corrects the defects in the classical Riemann theory and both simplifies and extends the Lebesgue theory of integration. Although this integral includes that of Lebesgue, its definition is very close to the Riemann integral that is familiar to students from calculus. One virtue of the new approach is that no measure theory and virtually no topology is required. Indeed, the book includes a study of measure theory as an application of the integral. <br /><br /> Part 1 fully develops the theory of the integral of functions defined on a compact interval. This restriction on the domain is not necessary, but it is the case of most interest and does not exhibit some of the technical problems that can impede the reader's understanding. Part 2 shows how this theory extends to functions defined on the whole real line. The theory of Lebesgue measure from the integral is then developed, and the author makes a connection with some of the traditional approaches to the Lebesgue integral. Thus, readers are given full exposure to the main classical results. <br /><br /> The text is suitable for a first-year graduate course, although much of it can be readily mastered by advanced undergraduate students. Included are many examples and a very rich collection of exercises. There are partial solutions to approximately one-third of the exercises. A complete solutions manual is available separately.</p> "

This text covers the central themes of operator theory, presented with the excellent clarity and style that readers have come to associate with Conway's writing. <br /><br /> Early chapters introduce and review material on C*-algebras, normal operators, compact operators and non-normal operators.  The topics include the spectral theorem, the functional calculus and the Fredholm index.  Also, some deep connections between operator theory and analytic functions are presented. <br /><br /> Later chapters cover more advanced topics, such as representations of C*-algebras, compact perturbations and von Neumann algebras.  Major results, such as the Sz.-Nagy Dilation Theorem, the Weyl-von Neumann-Berg Theorem and the classification of von Neumann algebras, are covered, as is a treatment of Fredholm theory.  These advanced topics are at the heart of current research. <br /><br /> The last chapter gives an introduction to reflexive subspaces, i.e., subspaces of operators that are determined by their invariant subspaces.  These, along with hyperreflexive spaces, are one of the more successful episodes in the modern study of asymmetric algebras. <br /><br /> Professor Conway's authoritative treatment makes this a compelling and rigorous course text, suitable for graduate students who have had a standard course in functional analysis.</p> "

Errors have been corrected, items have been rephrased, and more mathematical expressions have been displayed for the purpose of clarity. <br /><br /> The newly added Chapter 12 provides broad overviews of the new developments that have surfaced in the last few years, with references to the literature for details. The bibliography has been updated and accordingly, almost double the size of the original one. <br /><br /> The faithful revision and contemporary design of this work offers time-honored expertise with modern functionality: A keenly appealing combination.

But the main examples come from projective curves, and slowly but surely the text moves toward the algebraic category. Proofs of the Riemann-Roch and Serre Duality Theorems are presented in an algebraic manner, via an adaptation of the adelic proof, expressed completely in terms of solving a Mittag-Leffler problem. Sheaves and cohomology are introduced as a unifying device in the latter chapters, so that their utility and naturalness are immediately obvious.
